# Introduction to ML - predicting house prices

I programmed in Python using the Jupyter platform, applying libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. I utilized correlation matrices and various statistical methods such as Z-score and R-Squared. I presented to my colleagues at the Mathematical Institute the basics of machine learning, referencing a specific problem from the link below. For training the model, I employed multilinear regression.
